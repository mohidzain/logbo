            why you chose to talk to them. Along with the observations of
            others, also note what problems you think you will face in making a

            This means whatever solution you arrive at, try to make it as
            sustainable as possible. Note here how your design can be more
            sustainable. If it uses less of the natural resources, or does not
            damage the environment, it is a sustainable solution?</label
